# thiccfont-chrome
Makes your text on chrome thicc with a single keyboard shortcut. 

## How to install
The plugin is not currently "packed" and has to be added to chrome via developer mode.

## How to use
The default key is Ctrl+J but it can be changed in the chrome addons keybindings menu. This command takes your currently focused element and replaces any english text in it with the corresponding 丅卄工匚匚 丅乇乂丅.

## Why would you do this?
* Never made a chrome addon before
* Thought it could be fun
* Found cool japanese letter mappings on the interwebs.
